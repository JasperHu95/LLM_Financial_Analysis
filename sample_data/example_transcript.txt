Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Q4 2022 earnings call. 
We're pleased to report a strong finish to the year with revenue growth of 12% year-over-year, reaching $2.5 billion in Q4. 
For the full year, our revenue was $9.2 billion, up 10% from 2021.

Looking ahead to 2023, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 12%. 
We're planning capital expenditures of approximately $500 million this year to support our expansion plans. 
Our earnings per share for the full year 2023 are projected to be between $3.50 and $3.70, up from $3.20 in 2022.

Our gross margin is expected to remain stable at around 45%, while we target operating margin expansion of 50 basis points. 
We're also targeting a net margin of approximately 18% for the year.

From a balance sheet perspective, we're maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
We expect our debt-to-equity ratio to remain around 0.4, and we're targeting a current ratio of 2.0. 
Our interest coverage ratio should remain strong at approximately 8x.

We'll continue to invest in R&D, with spending expected to be about 6% of revenue. 
Our dividend yield remains at 2.5%, and we're committed to maintaining this payout ratio.

We expect EBITDA margins to improve by 100 basis points to approximately 25%.

Our return on equity is projected to be 15%, and return on assets at 8%. 
We're targeting a quick ratio of 1.5 and expect our price-to-earnings ratio to be in line with industry peers at around 18x.
